# cyphernode-pier
a pier script management configuration for cyphernode operators


## Installing pier

If you dont have rust 
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Feels sketchy?

Get it from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
if you dont trust me :)

After installing cargo:
```
cargo install pier
```
## Setting up a pier for cyphernode

Finally, copy the `pier.toml` file into the root directory of your cyphernode installation.

Note: *Pier commands only work from the folder containing the pier.toml file.*

## Using pier

To see all available commands:
```
pier list
```

To see all available commands with tag filters:

```
# only want proxy related commands
pier list -f proxy

# only want bitcoin related commands
pier list -f bitcoin
```

To run a command

```
# Format: pier <command> <args>
# check version
pier version
```
## Adding your own pier commands

using the `version` command as an example:

```
[scripts.version]
alias='v'
command='''
#/bin/bash

head -10 build.sh | grep CYPHERNODE | grep -oP '".*"' 
exit 0;
'''
